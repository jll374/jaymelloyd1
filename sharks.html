<!-- Main Discription about Nautilus Explorer-->

<article class="boat">
<h3> 6 Days Out at Sea </h3>
<p> Guadulupe Island is 180 miles from the Mexico coastline. The coast of Guadalupe is 25 miles of rocky cliffs with forest located on the island. Only one small village lives on the island, but guest from the liveaboards are not permitted to get off the boat. </p>

<p> This location is the number one place to see great white sharks due to the water being clear and not as cold as South Africa and California. While diving you can expect between 100 and 150 feet of visibility in cobalt blue water. </p>

<p> Most of the divers on this boat had their diving certification, but it was not a requirement to see the sharks.  None divers could use the surface cage, which had plenty of shark action. Certified divers used the surmerged cage that went 30ft underwater. </p>

<p> Certified divers had the opportunity to do three dives per day in the submersible cages and unlimited time in the surface cages. Diving started at 6:30 a.m. and closed up shop at dusk. </p>

<p> If you you are interested in taking this trip there are only a handful of companies that are available. I booked a trip on the <a href="https://nautilusliveaboards.com/" target="_blank">Nautilus Explorer</a>. </p>
