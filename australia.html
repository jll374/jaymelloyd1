<h2>Living Abroad</h2>
<img src="images/australiazoo.jpg" class="zoo" alt="zoo"> <p> I had always wanted to live in another country, and in college I wasn't able to participate in the study abroad program.  So, in my twenties I started traveling for extended periods of time overseas. While traveling one summer around Australia I learned about a visa that permitted foreigners to live and work for one year in the country. The visa was incredibly cheap and easy to obtain, but the trick was that you could only work for an employer no longer than 6 months.  Many travelers who apply for this visa work at farms or hostels while backpacking around the country.  I decided to get an office job and settle down in Sydney, since I had a couple friends living in the area. </p> 

<p> I still made time to travel to other parts of Australia while working in Sydney.  I took weekend trips with friends and flew to other regions of the country. It was during this time that I obtained my scuba diving certification and went on my first big dive trip to see the Great Barrier Reef.  My last adventure was a trip across the country to see Perth and Margaret River. My favorite part of Western Australia was seeing the wild Kangaroos running around in the fields.  They are almost like spotting deer in the United States! </p>

 <p> Living abroad was one my most memorable traveling experiences. One reason that it was so amazing was the fact that I lived at the beach.  Sunday Funday was at a bar overlooking the ocean and late night hangouts were sitting on the beach. My jogging path was along the coast and went from Coogee Beach all the way to the famous Bondi Beach. You can't get a better view on a distance run! The weather was perfect most of the time, since I arrived in their summer.  Daily swims in the ocean were common, and I even tried to learn how to surf! </p>
